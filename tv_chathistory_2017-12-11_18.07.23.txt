USER-THINK 6:07 PM
I can hear you
USER-THINK 6:07 PM
can you hear me ?
LENOVO-PC 6:07 PM
no
USER-THINK 6:08 PM
ok lets just do it here
USER-THINK 6:08 PM
I can hear you, and my mic is working
USER-THINK 6:08 PM
but somehow it doesn't make a sound on your side
LENOVO-PC 6:09 PM
i was thinking, with the game to maybe use a randomizing for computer to selectbutton
USER-THINK 6:09 PM
yeah
USER-THINK 6:09 PM
I think that's the next step
LENOVO-PC 6:09 PM
om
LENOVO-PC 6:09 PM
ok
USER-THINK 6:09 PM
to make computer play on its own
LENOVO-PC 6:09 PM
yeah
USER-THINK 6:09 PM
so let's go into your code
USER-THINK 6:10 PM
ok
USER-THINK 6:10 PM
before we continue, any questions from last week ?
LENOVO-PC 6:11 PM
could i ask about sender as Button what it means again
USER-THINK 6:12 PM
it means, cast sender (which is of type object) as a Button
LENOVO-PC 6:12 PM
ok
USER-THINK 6:12 PM
if sender object is incidentally also a Button, you will get sender as a Button instance
USER-THINK 6:13 PM
if let's say sender is anything but a Button, e.g. a TextField, you would get a null
USER-THINK 6:13 PM
this is almost similar to

Button btn = (Button) sender;
USER-THINK 6:13 PM
both are casting
USER-THINK 6:13 PM
but the latter will throw an  Exception instead
LENOVO-PC 6:14 PM
thanks
USER-THINK 6:14 PM
an Exception would be thrown if the types are incompatible when you do =  (Button) sender;
USER-THINK 6:15 PM
any other questions ?
USER-THINK 6:15 PM
a Dictionary is a collection, similar to a list
USER-THINK 6:15 PM
a list contains a set of objects
USER-THINK 6:16 PM
a dictionary is distinguished by its behavior in containing  key, value pairs
LENOVO-PC 6:16 PM
EventHandler is that the action of button cllicked
USER-THINK 6:17 PM
if you have a Dictionary<int, String>, you can store {1: "apple", 2: "banana", 3: "orange" }
USER-THINK 6:17 PM
in this case, we have { Button1 : EventHandler1, Button2: EventHandler2 }
USER-THINK 6:17 PM
and so on
USER-THINK 6:18 PM
the keys are of type Button
USER-THINK 6:18 PM
the values are of type EventHandlers
USER-THINK 6:19 PM
in this case we store the  EventHandler for each Button
USER-THINK 6:20 PM
this is where we are saying, for key btn1, store the EventHandler to the dictionary, with key btn1, and the value is the new EventHandler
LENOVO-PC 6:20 PM
what is an eventhandler
USER-THINK 6:21 PM
EventHandler is a delegate
USER-THINK 6:21 PM
it can store a function
USER-THINK 6:21 PM
in this case, the EventHandler stores function play_a_turn
USER-THINK 6:22 PM
first we create an EventHandler that points to play_a_turn
USER-THINK 6:22 PM
then we say, for this button, if I Click, then call the delegate function
USER-THINK 6:22 PM
which in this case calls play_a_turn
USER-THINK 6:23 PM
so every time you click, play_a_turn is executed
LENOVO-PC 6:23 PM
thats cool
USER-THINK 6:23 PM
you can see this behavior ... if we set a breakpoint
USER-THINK 6:25 PM
so play_a_turn has been executed
USER-THINK 6:25 PM
one more thing...
USER-THINK 6:26 PM
you can see under Watch
USER-THINK 6:26 PM
there are 9 pairs in the btns_evt_handlers dictionary
USER-THINK 6:26 PM
and for each item, you have a key & value pair
USER-THINK 6:26 PM
the type of the key is System.Windows.Forms.Button
USER-THINK 6:27 PM
the type of the value is a System.EventHandler
USER-THINK 6:27 PM
is that clear ?
LENOVO-PC 6:28 PM
yes thanks
USER-THINK 6:28 PM
each of the key is unique
USER-THINK 6:28 PM
that's a significant property of a dictionary
LENOVO-PC 6:28 PM
understand
USER-THINK 6:28 PM
the value can be non-unique
USER-THINK 6:28 PM
but in this particular case they are unique
USER-THINK 6:29 PM
we create one EventHandler for each Button
USER-THINK 6:29 PM
a total of 9 delegates
USER-THINK 6:29 PM
however, they all point to one function
USER-THINK 6:30 PM
that's slightly inaccurate
USER-THINK 6:30 PM
EventHandler is a delegate
USER-THINK 6:30 PM
you have 9 delegates here
USER-THINK 6:30 PM
each delegate points to the same method
USER-THINK 6:31 PM
yeap
USER-THINK 6:31 PM
that's better
LENOVO-PC 6:31 PM
can we look into computers turn in game
USER-THINK 6:31 PM
yeah
USER-THINK 6:32 PM
so, let's jump to where it's the computer's turn
USER-THINK 6:33 PM
great
USER-THINK 6:34 PM
ok. actually, we want the computer to play a turn right after the player
USER-THINK 6:34 PM
so this is where we want to start
USER-THINK 6:35 PM
go ahead
LENOVO-PC 6:35 PM
make a new method for randomizing
USER-THINK 6:35 PM
we don't have to 
USER-THINK 6:35 PM
not yet
USER-THINK 6:35 PM
well you can if you want
USER-THINK 6:35 PM
yeah that's good
LENOVO-PC 6:36 PM
should we return a button
USER-THINK 6:36 PM
so when you have a biig problem, with uncertain solution, start with the simplest thing you can do
USER-THINK 6:36 PM
basically, before you go random
USER-THINK 6:37 PM
make the computer always play the middle spot
USER-THINK 6:37 PM
how would you do that ?
USER-THINK 6:38 PM
I'll show you how now
USER-THINK 6:39 PM
you want to go ahead and do it ?
USER-THINK 6:42 PM
yeah
USER-THINK 6:42 PM
that's what you're missing
USER-THINK 6:42 PM
working ?
LENOVO-PC 6:43 PM
no
USER-THINK 6:43 PM
let me see
USER-THINK 6:51 PM
how is that ?
LENOVO-PC 6:52 PM
last one didnt register
USER-THINK 6:52 PM
hmm..
USER-THINK 6:52 PM
let me see
USER-THINK 6:54 PM
so the last button is problematic for the player
LENOVO-PC 6:54 PM
yeah
USER-THINK 6:55 PM
ok this is where we want to do debugging
LENOVO-PC 6:55 PM
we need draw option
USER-THINK 6:59 PM
basically what's happening is the computer couldn't find an empty spot
USER-THINK 6:59 PM
so it's looping
USER-THINK 7:00 PM
ahh I know the simplest solution
USER-THINK 7:01 PM
lol
LENOVO-PC 7:02 PM
can we see if both lose
USER-THINK 7:02 PM
a draw
USER-THINK 7:02 PM
yeah
USER-THINK 7:02 PM
there is no code for that yet
USER-THINK 7:02 PM
you have a draw when emptySpots is 0
USER-THINK 7:02 PM
the code isn't right still
LENOVO-PC 7:03 PM
the computer does an additional move when all buttons are used
USER-THINK 7:03 PM
yeah
USER-THINK 7:04 PM
that's ok
USER-THINK 7:04 PM
only a little bit more
LENOVO-PC 7:05 PM
we have run out of time can we do the last lot next wek
LENOVO-PC 7:05 PM
week
USER-THINK 7:05 PM
just 1 or 2 more lines I think
LENOVO-PC 7:05 PM
ok
USER-THINK 7:08 PM
that's ok
LENOVO-PC 7:08 PM
awesome!
USER-THINK 7:08 PM
but something is wrong when you won and go to the next round
USER-THINK 7:08 PM
we need to reset whose turn it is
LENOVO-PC 7:08 PM
ok
USER-THINK 7:09 PM
that's it !
LENOVO-PC 7:10 PM
do you know what is wrong with recceiving sound on your end
LENOVO-PC 7:10 PM
with teamviewer
USER-THINK 7:10 PM
actually I can hear you fine
LENOVO-PC 7:10 PM
i dont hear you
USER-THINK 7:10 PM
and my mic audio input is detecte
USER-THINK 7:10 PM
I can see the level go up and down when I speak
LENOVO-PC 7:11 PM
dont hear anything
USER-THINK 7:11 PM
but somehow it doesn't get across to you
USER-THINK 7:11 PM
we can try Skype next time if you want
LENOVO-PC 7:11 PM
this is fine 
USER-THINK 7:12 PM
it is one of the challenges with remote learning 
LENOVO-PC 7:12 PM
I'll test the game a little bit
USER-THINK 7:12 PM
ok
USER-THINK 7:12 PM
try to make a backup
USER-THINK 7:12 PM
or commit to a repository first
LENOVO-PC 7:13 PM
could we test this with test code and put to repository next week
USER-THINK 7:13 PM
ok
USER-THINK 7:13 PM
same time as usual ?
LENOVO-PC 7:13 PM
will pay you after tut and maybe teamviewer will work next time
LENOVO-PC 7:14 PM
i'll test the sound on my machine as well with a game or something
LENOVO-PC 7:14 PM
same time
LENOVO-PC 7:15 PM
wait i need to copy the chat we have donein case for future reference
